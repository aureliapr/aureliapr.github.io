                    <h1 class="mb-4">Why explore the impacts of critical pedagogy in computer science education?</h1>
                    <p>When examining examples of technological design in society, they often cater to a single type of user. 
                        Technology continues to perpetuate the matrix of domination. There are well-documented instance
                         of technological design failing people with different abilities, identities, and
                          knowledge. One example of a technology that fails to include all users is the 
                          soap dispenser. Many soap sensors fail to recognize deeper skin tones. This
                         is an example of a technological dysfunction that negatively impacts marginalized people in their everyday 
                         lives. So why is this happening? Designers are not intentionally trying to exclude users. But they have not been trained to think about inclusive 
                         design practices. Changing the way society approaches technological design starts in undergraduate education. By incorporating ethical thinking into computer science education, we can instill 
                         a sense of responsibility in upcoming software engineers and designers. </p>

                <h1 class="mb-5">What were the limitations of previous studies?</h1>
                <p> Professors have been integrating critical pedagogy into undergraduate computer science education. So far, they have found that the intergration of ethics into a final integrative class at the end of university is not effective. However, the integration throughout students' college education is more effective. One limitation of previous research, however, is that it only provided qualitative evidence for how effective the integration of critical pedagogy was.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center">Our Study</h1>
                <p class = "text-center"> In our study, author 4 integrated critical pedagogy into a Software Design class in a midwestern liberal arts college. 
                    They integrated pedagogy utilizing two frameworks from prior works.
                    The first is the CIDER elicitation technique, which is a framework that helps students analyze assumptions embedded in technology. Throughout the software design class students created a database backed website. After every technical milestone they did a cider analysis of their product. 
                    The second way was by making the values embedded in technology explicit in lecture and classwork. 
                    In prior iterations of software design, professors lectured about the benefits and drawbacks of a technology. 
                    Our iteration of the class went over the benefits and drawbacks, as well as going over who the intended users of a certain technology were, the technologyâ€™s purpose, and the values embedded in that technology. 
                    </p>
                <p class = "text-center"> In addition to qualitative analysis we were among the first to use a validated survey called Crit Con Index to measure changes in attitudes towards critical reflection and agency quanitatively. 
                    Our study provides quantitative and qualitative evidence to answer the questions:</p>

                    <li><strong>To what extent</strong> does the integration of critical pedagogy in post-secondary software desing changel students' attitudes towards critical reflection & agency?</li>

The difference between students' pre and post attitudes around personal effectiveness had a large effect size (V = 0, p = 6.388 10^{-5}, r = 0.834). This finding suggests that the concepts and skills learned in the software design course changed students' beliefs in their ability to discuss and act on ethical issues. Before software design students were between slightly disagreeing and agreeing that they had personal effectiveness. After taking software design, they agreed that they had personal effectiveness. This shows improvement in personal effectiveness.</p>

                    A potential explanation for <strong>how</strong> changes in <strong>personal effectiveness</strong> and 
                    <strong>valuing marginalized perspectives</strong> occurred is that classwork facilitated students' 
                    critical reflection. Several classwork assignments asked students to evaluate the assumptions about 
                    users embedded in various technology. The diversity of assignments allowed students to learn how to 
                    identify a wide variety of assumptions. For example, the first assignment that students completed 
                    was analyzing the assumptions, intended users, and values embedded in Unix & Vim. The top three 
                    types of assumptions students identified made up more than half of the assumptions. However, in the 
                    last assignment, where students used CIDER to analyze their web applications, they identified a 
                    wider variety of assumptions â€” 16 different types of assumptions compared to 11 in Unix & Vim.

                <p>Based on the assumptions students identified, they implemented fixes to their web applications. The top type of fix students implemented on their website were accessibility-related fixes. Students accomplished this through text-to-speech functionality, tab-based navigation or color-blind friendly palettes. The fixes allowed users with visual, motor or auditory constraints to access their website.
                This was a top fix likely because students were exposed to lots of examples of technology that reflected ability-based assumptions about their users. </p>

                <p>The top three fixes, that were not implemented were related to information on their project's database, navigation on the web application, and feature changes. Since the teams came up with more improvements in those categories, they implemented some of them but did not necessarily have time to get to all of them. In addition, feature changes are more difficult to implement than other types of improvements as they require more time, code, and technical knowledge.
                Students were constrained by our institution's 10-week term and most students take 2 additional classes in addition to this class. This further limited their time. </p>

                <p>Through active practice of both critical reflection and agency in their classwork, students might have felt more comfortable acting on ethical issues, perhaps explaining their increased personal effectiveness.

                <p> One theme that we found in our interviews is that students' value for marginalized perspectives went from being an ideal to a practice. Throughout the course, students developed their understanding of how to include marginalized perspectives in the design of technology. At the start of the course, they had a general idea of the importance of marginalized perspectives. However, it was not until after software design that they developed concrete strategies to accommodate marginalized groups of people.</p>
                <p> In <strong>Penguin's</strong> interview they explicitly reflected on how the CIDER elicitation technique created a framework for considering the impacts of a technology on marginalized groups. CIDER helped students analyze technological design and develop feasable changes to accomodate marginalized communities. It was a key driver in developing students agency.</p>
                <p> Through CIDER students reflected on a variety of impacts from the indivdual to societal scale. See quotes from <strong>Womp</strong> and <strong>Chem</strong> which demonstrate the scopes of impact different students analyzed.</p>
                <p>After continual use of CIDER students began to value inclusive and ethical design practices, see a quote from <strong>Blue Eye Samurai</strong> that highlights this.</p>
